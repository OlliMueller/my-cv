        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate about enabling people to reach their full potential
          through IT solutions so that they can have a positive impact on their
          environment. I am looking forward to being in the role of a learner
          now, so that I can pass on my know-how to others as soon as the time
          is right.

            I am on the fast track to becoming a web developer - motivated,
            willing to learn and as the German saying goes
            <q>Fehler sind die besten Helfer</q> with the courage to make
            mistakes to become a better and better developer day by day.

            As a community pastor, it was my responsibility and passion to show
            new internationals in Munich individual ways to arrive and gain a
            foothold in the church and the region. My tasks ranged from
            integration and language courses as well as job training for
            refugees to placing volunteers in various areas of the church.
